## Expression Evaluator

The Expression Evaluator is a simple Java-based tool that reads mathematical expressions from a file, tokenizes them, and prints out each token with its type (such as numbers, operators, brackets, or trigonometric functions). The project demonstrates basic concepts of file handling, tokenization, and object-oriented programming in Java. This evaluator can be extended further to handle complex arithmetic and expressions with operator precedence or parentheses evaluation.
